        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>My Home Town</h3>
        <p>Allow me to introduce myself as Vikum Pramilan, hailing from the beautiful island of Sri Lanka. As I reminisce about my childhood, I feel truly blessed to have spent those precious years in the enchanting town of Matara, nestled close to the breathtaking sea. Matara, with its stunning coastal views, became the backdrop of my fondest memories. From building sandcastles on pristine beaches to experiencing the soothing rhythm of crashing waves, every day held a touch of magic. Matara gifted me a childhood filled with wonder, and its coastal charm will forever hold a special place in my heart. </p>
        <h3>My School</h3>
        <p>During my formative years, I had the privilege of attending Matara Rahula College, a renowned institution and one of the largest boys' schools in the southern province of Sri Lanka. As I reflect on my educational journey, I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that Rahula College provided. The school's rich history and commitment to academic excellence shaped my character and prepared me for the challenges ahead. Surrounded by a vibrant community of students and dedicated teachers, I forged lifelong friendships and acquired invaluable knowledge. Rahula College holds a special place in my heart, as it laid the foundation for my personal and academic growth.</p>
